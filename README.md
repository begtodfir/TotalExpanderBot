# TotalExpanderBot
This is a Discord bot that aims to crack down on maliciously vague short links that seek to perform some kind of phish on Discord users. It does this by automatically (without explicit command) expands any short URL posted in a Discord comment and submits the expanded URL to VirusTotal for analysis.
